# Book Management System

## Overview
This project implements a backend system for a "Book Management" application, designed to manage users, books, and borrowing transactions efficiently. The system adheres to RESTful API principles and incorporates industry-standard security practices.

## Features

### 1. User Management
- User registration with a unique username and secure password storage.
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
- JWT-based authentication ensures secure API access.

### 2. Book Management
- Add new books with details such as Title, Author, Genre, and Published Year.
- Retrieve a list of all books.
- Search for books by title or author.
- Update book details.
- Delete books from the system.

### 3. Borrowing and Returning Books
- Users can borrow one or more books using their respective IDs.
- Borrowed books can be returned through the system.

## API Development
- Implements RESTful API design using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Returns meaningful HTTP status codes and structured responses.
- Validates incoming requests and gracefully handles errors.
- JWT authentication secures API endpoints.

## Database Design
- **Tables/Collections:**
  - `Users`: Stores user details, including hashed passwords.
  - `Books`: Contains book-related information.
  - `Borrow_Transactions`: Tracks book borrowing records for each user.
- **Key Queries:**
  - Retrieve all books borrowed by a specific user.
  - Search for books based on title or author.
  - Identify the most frequently borrowed books.
  - Optimize queries using indexing strategies.

## Security and Cryptography
- Implements bcrypt for secure password hashing.
- JWT-based authentication for API security.
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection.
- Utility for text encryption and decryption.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm OR Python/Java/Golang (depending on the chosen tech stack).
- Set up [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or MongoDB for database operations.

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd book-management-api
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # for Node.js
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # for Python
   ```
3. Configure environment variables (e.g., `.env` file).
4. Apply database migrations:
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate  # for Django
   npm run migrate  # for Node.js with Sequelize
   ```
5. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start  # for Node.js
   python manage.py runserver  # for Django
   ```

## API Documentation
- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:8000/api/`
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /register` - Register a new user.
  - `POST /login` - Authenticate a user.
  - `GET /books` - Retrieve all books.
  - `POST /books` - Add a new book.
  - `PUT /books/{id}` - Update a book.
  - `DELETE /books/{id}` - Delete a book.
  - `POST /borrow` - Borrow books.
  - `POST /return` - Return books.

## Testing
- Utilize Postman or cURL to test API endpoints.
- Run unit tests:
  ```sh
  npm test  # for Node.js
  pytest  # for Python
  ```

## Deployment (Optional Enhancements)
- Deploy the application on AWS, GCP, or Heroku.
- Use Docker for containerization and streamlined deployment.
